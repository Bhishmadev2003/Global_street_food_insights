# 🌍 global-street-food-insights

This project analyzes global street food data using a full-stack data workflow — from raw data cleaning in **SQL**, preprocessing and analysis in **Python (Pandas)**, quick checks in **Excel**, to final visualization with an interactive **Power BI dashboard**. The goal is to understand trends, popular cuisines, regional preferences, and pricing patterns.
